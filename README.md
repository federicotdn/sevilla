The objective of Sevilla is to allow you to quickly write down notes on your computer and mobile phone and read them at another time.

Sevilla tries to be as lightweight as possible, and avoids adding any unecessary steps between having an idea or thought and writing it down. Sevilla doesn't aim to be a full-fledged notes management system, and therefore has a very limited set of features.

Other properties of Sevilla include:

- It's completely self-hosted and uses an SQL database to store notes (tested on SQLite and PostgreSQL).
- Uses Flask and SQLAlchemy on the backend side.
- Has a minimalistic frontend made with vanilla JavaScript, making it quick to load.
- Can be used as a clipboard between devices.
- It works pretty well on slow connections (tested on EDGE).
